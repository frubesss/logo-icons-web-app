# Logo Icons Web App

A demo web application built to showcase the functionality of the [Logo Icons Lookup API](https://github.com/frubesss/logo-icons-lookup-api-deno), allowing users to search and view company logo icons in real-time. This app demonstrates how to use the API to filter and display logos based on search terms, making it ideal for applications that need to visualize logos dynamically.
